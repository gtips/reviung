# Middle plate  
An acrylic plate sandwiched between the top plate and the main PCB, and between the main PCB and the bottom plate.  
The rigidity of the keyboard increases and the weight also increases, which gives a sense of stability when typing.  
The typing sound will also be a little quieter.  

Includes Hi-Pro frame.  
  
Install without cutting the outer frame of the main PCB.
